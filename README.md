My game is called "Cupcake Fantasy". It requires a single playable character to move around the screen in order to collect cupcakes which fall from the sky at random locations. THe charatcer has to collect at least 15 cupcakes in a matter of 2 minutes or the character loses the game. PLayers can also compete against each other to see who scores the highest and if they can collect more than the required minimum amount of cupcakes. PLayers have a chance to immediately play the game again once it ends.
